# About

This project is part of my elixir learning experience.
What's in here is a backend/db port of the clojure
repo: https://github.com/dannicolici/news

Please visit the original repo for details about
functionality. This is only focused on switching
the backend to phoenix/elixir, while keeping the
frontend in clojurescript.

## TODO

- remove clojure & redis backend
- update README with details about installing/running the project
